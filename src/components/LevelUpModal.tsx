		case 4:
			return "You've done things the hard way. But without taking risks, taking responsibility for failure... how could you have understood?";
		case 5:
			return "Everything you do is just a bit easier, more instinctive, more satisfying. It is as though you had suddenly developed keen senses and instincts.";

		case 18:
			return "With the life you've been living, the punishment your body has taken... there are limits, and maybe you've reached them. Is this what it's like to grow old?";
