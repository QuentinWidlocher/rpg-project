# Web RPG Project

Built with Solid Start + DaisyUI, this is a textual game based on D&D 5e system featuring branching dialogs with skill checks, turn based combat, dungeon dwelling (TBD) and idle game parts (TBD).

Feel free to create issues or PR if you can read my atrocious code. (Disclaimer: I did this project to feel the dopamine rush of doing complex TS types so it's a real journey)

You can use the project tab to see what needs to be done (or where I left this project 5 years ago)
